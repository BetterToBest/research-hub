## 1. Project Overview
The **Better To Best Research Hub** is an open-access initiative comprising 14 peer-reviewable papers. The research focuses on the structural elimination of poverty through integrated economic and civic architectures. It proposes a "Compassionate Meritocracy" that secures basic human needs while incentivizing high-value productivity and community contribution.

## 2. Core Economic Architectures

### Creative Currency Octaves (CCO)
CCO is a dual-currency system designed for post-scarcity and automation-driven economies.
* **Basic Units (BU):** An opt-in currency for essentials (food, housing, utilities) that expires monthly to prevent hoarding and ensure circulation.
* **Primary Currency:** Used for discretionary spending and long-term wealth.
* **Conversion Multipliers:** Businesses and creators can convert BU into primary currency at rates ranging from **1x to 9x**, depending on their "Octave Level."
* **The Phi-Rate:** A qualitative multiplier (~1.618x) applied to work recognized for exceptional beauty, utility, or social harmony.

### Public Trust Foundations (PTF) & Housing (PTH)
These entities provide the physical and commercial stability required for the CCO system to function.
* **Public Trust Foundations:** Not-for-profit community businesses that provide foundational goods.
* **Public Trust Housing:** A model for community-owned housing where residents hold collective equity and exercise democratic control.

## 3. Civic & Governance Frameworks

### Citizens Internet Portal (CIP)
The digital infrastructure for the entire ecosystem. It handles:
* Secure management of CCO basic units and primary currency.
* Transparent democratic voting for PTH/PTF management.
* Direct communication between citizens and regional planners.

### Social Zone Harmonization (SZH)
A framework for regional organization that allows communities to self-sort based on lifestyle preferences (e.g., family-focused, wellness-focused, or high-creativity zones) while maintaining overarching democratic coordination.

2. **Dual-Currency Inflation:** Stability analysis of expiring vs. non-expiring currency.
3. **Simulation Analysis:** Monte Carlo and agent-based modeling of the CCO-PTF framework.
4. **Real Estate Transformation:** Strategies for transitioning to Public Trust Housing.
