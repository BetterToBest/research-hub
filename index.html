        <h2>Key Concepts & Definitions</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>Creative Currency Octaves (CCO)</dt>
            <dd>A dual-currency system that ensures each citizen's basic needs are met while maintaining a free market that rewards productivity and creativity.</dd>
            <dd>Key Components: Basic units (universal distribution), Conversion system (expired basic units to primary currency), Octave levels (doubling conversion capacity amounts), Personal conversion rates (1x-9x multiplier based on contribution quality, plus an additional Phi-rate (Φ) multiplier of 1.618x for beautiful or harmonious works.)</dd>
            
            <dt>Basic Units</dt>
            <dd>The foundational currency units in the CCO system, pegged 1:1 to primary currency, and restricted to essential expenditures (housing, food, utilities, non-luxury transportation). They expire at the end of each distribution cycle. Primary currency is still universally traded and utilized.</dd>
            <dd>Implementation: Basic units can be distributed digitally for debit card use, as well as printed at ATMs as receipt-paper currency with scan codes for cash transactions.</dd>
            
            <dt>Creative Collectives</dt>
            <dd>Community-organized groups of artists, innovators, and cultural contributors who administer the coversion of expired basic units into primary currency at elevated levels. Creative Collective members receive enhanced recognition and elevated conversion rates for work that benefits the broader community. Creative Collective Charters may be numerous and varied, such as: Industry-specific, regional, local, age-based, rural, urban, etc. Participants may choose to opt-in by contributing productive work or value, and sharing it in positive ways.</dd>
            <dd>Key Functions: Collaborative project management, Resource sharing, Peer mentorship, Community cultural development, Collective octave advancement, Transparent elevated conversion-rate review processes.</dd>
            
            <dt>Octave Levels And Conversion Rates</dt>
            <dd>Progressive advancement in the CCO system that determines conversion capacity levels, and conversion rates. Named after musical octaves due to the doubling frequency pattern, each octave level doubles the previous level's conversion capacity (Base_Capacity × 2^n). Capacity amounts may be capped for businesses by operational limits, yet uncapped for individual or collective achievemnt-based recognition.</dd>
            <dd>Conversion rates of expired basic units into primary currency are earned through transparent systems and based upon factors including productivity, efficiency, creativity, quality, and beauty. Rates range from a 1-9x multiplier, plus an additional Golden-Ratio inspired 'Phi-rate' of ~1.618x for beautiful or harmonious works, thereby offering greater-than-face-value for expired basic units. 
            <dd>Examples: A band that sells-out stadium concert venues for low-priced expired basics may qualify for a conversion rate of 7x, with unlimited conversion amounts of expired basics into primary currency. A small restaurant with limited business hours that accepts basic units for payment can only convert a daily amount that doesn't exceed their opeartional capacity. If a restaurant offers meal options for low basic unit prices (3-breakfast, 4-lunch, 5-dinner) they may qualify for elevated conversion rates of 2-4x.</dd>
            
            <dt>Public Trust Housing (PTH)</dt>
            <dd>Community-owned housing model that creates pathways for collective wealth building while providing stable, affordable housing. Properties are held in public trust and owned collectively by residents through democratic governance structures. PTH complements rather than replaces the private real estate market, offering an additional housing option alongside traditional homeownership and rental markets.</dd>
            <dd>Key Features: Democratic resident control, Housing equity accounts, Integrated services (home maintenance, repairs, and upkeep), Collective wealth building.</dd>

            <dt>Public Trust Foundations (PTF)</dt>
            <dd>Community-owned asset model that generates employment opportunities and pathways for collective wealth building while providing foundational goods and services. Grocers, counter-serve restaurants, utilitiy providers and other businesses that accept basic units as payment may operate within a public trust network that's collectively owned by citizens and operated as 'not-for-profit,' and 'for-community-benefit.' PTF firms have democratic governance structures, and complement rather than replace private market operations.</dd>
            <dd>Key Features: Democratic citizen control, Integrated services (transportation and logistical support for foundational goods/services, childcare, healthcare, education), Operational efficiency.</dd>
            
            <dt>Social Zone Harmonization (SZH)</dt>
            <dd>A comprehensive framework for organizing communities and regions to optimize social, economic, and environmental outcomes through coordinated planning and resource allocation while maintaining local autonomy.</dd>
            <dd>Examples: Family-safe zones, adult-only zones with relaxed drug-laws, artist and maker districts, recovery and wellness zones.</dd>
            
            <dt>Citizen Internet Portal (CIP)</dt>
            <dd>Digital infrastructure platform that enables democratic participation, transparent governance, and community-controlled economic systems. Facilitates CCO operations, PTH/PTF governance, and civic engagement through secure, privacy-focused technology.</dd>
