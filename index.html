            <p>This open research project develops innovative economic and governance systems designed to eliminate poverty while preserving market dynamism. These frameworks—Creative Currency Octaves, Public Trust Housing, Public Trust Foundations, and Social Zone Harmonization—offer practical, implementable alternatives to current welfare systems.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Core Mission:</strong> Create economically coherent systems that guarantee basic needs while rewarding creativity, productivity, and community contribution.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Current Status:</strong> Theoretical, preliminary simulation results require academic refinement.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Currently Seeking:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Academic researchers to review and test theoretical foundations</li>
                <li>Economists to validate simulation models and suggest improvements</li>
                <li>Policy makers interested in pilot program design</li>
                <li>Communities willing to explore implementation feasibility studies</li>
                <li>Developers to build open-source tools for the Citizens Internet Portal</li>

                <h3 id="cco-heading">Creative Currency Octaves (CCO)</h3>
                <p>A dual-currency system where citizens may opt-in to receive 'basic units' for essentials (food, housing, utilities) that expire monthly, offering guaranteed basic survival plus unlimited earning potential through a conversion system operated by a distributed network of institutional collectives.</p>
                
                <p><strong>How it works:</strong> Businesses and creators who accept basic units as payment can convert them to primary currency at elevated rates (1x-9x multiplier, plus a 'Phi-rate' bonus of 1.618x for exceptional quality or beauty). Conversion capacity scales through "octave levels" that double at each tier, rewarding high-volume contributors and cultural innovators.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Key innovation:</strong> Separates survival security from market participation while creating powerful incentives for affordable, high-quality goods and services.</p>

                <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Distributed digitally for debit card use, or printed at ATMs as receipt-paper currency with scan codes for cash transactions.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Ensures circulation rather than hoarding, while directing economic activity toward meeting community needs.</p>
